 ## 2021-10 Sponsored plate from PCBWay
PCBWay kindly offered sponsorship of a free PCB, I've been qurious about OSP surface finish for a good while, so I thought I'd do a set of protos and test this out. 

### Why OSP?
What I find compelling about OSP is mainly the fact that it's a enviromentally friendly finish that's both cost effective and gives a nice/cool look.

In theory, OSP gives a very flat surface with good solderability that should give a similar result as HASL.

One of the main drawbacks is the shelflife and durability of the surface. HASL and ENIG which is often used with keeb PCBs are very strong surfaces with good shelf life.

## The PCB:
I had a PCB in the pipeline for proto, so I thought this would be a good fit. It's a perkey-rgb 60%.

I got the regular black PCB with OSP. I generally prefer matte black sodlermask to the shiny black, but it looks pretty good I'd say. The OSP finish has a very nice look.
