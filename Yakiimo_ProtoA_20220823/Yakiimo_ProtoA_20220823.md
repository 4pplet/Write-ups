**Done:**

Ok, so I've had this case for a while waiting for me to do a proper test build and try it out and evaluate things. Scroll to the end for tlrd.

First of all, amazing work by Peppy, Kkatano and GEON, thanks for having me in this project. It's been really fun so far :D

I have the "Proto A" with slight variations compared to "Proto B" that Peppy has. I'll give my input based on the proto I have. Some of the things I mention, I know is different on Peppys board and more changes is planned for change in the future.

# Building experience and overall construction

I love the simplicity of this case. It's easy to build and due to the plateless nature, very easy to modify and change for example a stab gone wrong. It really is a no nonsense and clean project. I'll be a bit biased, but I really like it. If you are not familiar with it, plateless is simply put a case that you build without using a plate. This can commonly be found in old Cherry boards and cheap tray mounts and generally give a soft feel. In tray mount boards, it's usually considered to not be a great idea due to an uneven stiffness.

I found the quality of the protos to be good, not perfect. Anno and surface finish is fine aside from a few defects. Really liking the burgundy color! I think it fits the project with the deep red a sweet potato can be, I also think a dark-ish purple could fit for the same reasons.

I accidentally built it with the spacers on the wrong side of the PCB at first as you can see in the pics. Luckily, Kkatano has a good note about this ^^

# Tad pole placements and PCB thickness

This will be a thing of preference, but I think my opinions will be pretty good for the general users. I usually like medium flex builds and generally don't build anything far outside of the norm.

First I built this case with the 1.6mm PCB, it feels good and uniform, but I feel it's a lot more lively and fun with the added flex from the 1.2mm. There was simply no going back to the 1.6mm. Due to the added flex of the 1.2mm PCB, it also introduces a slight less uniform feel, but I still prefer this. I found using these tadpole positions gave me the most uniform feel and best typing experience:

For my personal preference, I'd go with the 1.2mm PCB and these positions.

The flex is quite a bit bigger at the edges, so mods will flex more and could cause issues for a heavy typist (bottoming out the PCB to the bottom of the case). I'm currently using the 60A hardness and I think they are a good fit and my preference. The flex at the enter key is similar to the flex at capslock. Due to the construction, it'll flex a tiny bit more at the capslock, since it's at the edge of the PCB, but i did not find it to be noticeable while typing. Overall a very soft typing feel, cozy like a steaming Yakiimo? ;)

# Case clearance and proto A vs proto B

Peppy did a good writup on this, so I'll not go into it much. There's some slight adjustments needed to the spacing between case and keycaps. Very well illustrated by Peppy and I'm glad I'm not crazy for seeing it.

In regards to Peppys note about the spacebar and mounting posts and my own experience, I think the proto I received that has the option of a tighter placement is best. I can't say much about the other differences in mounting post placements, but I don't think they will have a massive influence in feel. The main point of excessive flex will be at the center of the short sides (for example capslock position) and I guess that the flex there is similar in both versions.  

Other differences to A vs B:

- Sandblasted weight is perfectly fine in my opinion
- Logo looks good in the proto I recieved
- No PCB issue, I guess there's a manufacturing error by JLC in Peppy's board. Very odd.

# Typing feel and sound

Typing sound is muted, especially mods and spacebar. Poppy boards tend to have a loud onion chopping sound from the spacebar that some like and **I really don't**. I really like the sound of the mods and space on this project. With GMK keycaps it's a mild clacky sound, with XMI it's a more poppy sound. I like the slightly more lively sound of the GMK clack on this one.

As previously mentioned, a heavy typist might have issues with the amount of flex and bottom out. For me, this is not an issue.

# Specs for the test build:

- **Switches:** Cherry Hyperglide Blacks, stock
- **Keyaps:** OG Cherry doubleshots + GMK RGB mods and XMI V1 for comparison.
- **Stabs:** A bit assorted, but mostly old stabs that I think hammer produced way way back.

For a proper build, I'd lube, spring swap and film the switches and use TX-stabs or regular cherry. Stock Hyperglide spring is so bad, wow.

# Changes for future revisions:

We have discussed a few changes. I think the most important ones is:
- Adjusting clearances to keycaps
- Updating tad-pole placements

For the other things discussed, check Kkatanos document. For purely personal reasons, I think it would be fun to be able to add a plate for SI/Alps/Topre builds in the future, but only if it does not in anyway compromise the current tad-pole mount. As far as tad-poles go, I do think this was a good choice for the project.

# TLDR
- Sounds and feels muted and soft. No onions!
- Simple and classic look
- Easy to build and tune (especially since there is no plate)
- Minor adjustments to case needed (covered by Peppy)
